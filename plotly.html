<p>In ‘ny_noaa’ data, there are 2595176 observations, which is a really
huge data. So, we would like to choose part of observations that we are
interested to form ‘part_ny_noaa’ data. In ‘part_ny_noaa’ data, we focus
on data between 2005 and 2010, and cleared missing data of tmax, tmin,
and prcp. However, there are also so many observations, so that we set a
random seed to help us random smapled 10000 observations in our
‘part_ny_noaa’.</p>

<p>This line plot shows mean maximum temperature in each month during
2005-2010. This result is consistent with the result of minimum
temperature. We could conclude that, in New York, the hottest time of
year is during June-August.</p>
